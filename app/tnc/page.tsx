                  Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's
                  provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or
                  implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the

                  reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the
                  Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
                  from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan

                  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties
                  or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all
                  of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a
                  case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be
                  applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
